Terminology used in trees
==================================

#### Node
A node is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure.
#### Root
The top node in a tree, the prime ancestor.
#### Child
A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root, an immediate descendant.
#### Parent
The converse notion of a child, an immediate ancestor.
#### Siblings
A group of nodes with the same parent.
#### Neighbor
Parent or child.
#### Descendant
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also known as subchild.
#### Ancestor
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
#### Leaf / External node (not common)
A node with no children.
#### Branch node / Internal node
A node with at least one child.
#### Degree
For a given node, its number of children. A leaf is necessarily degree zero. The degree of a tree is the degree of its root.
#### Degree of tree
The degree of the root.
#### Edge
The connection between one node and another.
#### Path
A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
#### Distance
The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.
#### Depth
The distance between a node and the root.
#### Level
1 + the number of edges between a node and the root, i.e. (Depth + 1)
#### Height
The number of edges on the longest path between a node and a descendant leaf.
#### Width
The number of nodes in a level.
#### Breadth
The number of leaves.
#### Height of tree
The height of the root node or the maximum level of any node in the tree
#### Forest
A set of n â‰¥ 0 disjoint trees.
#### Sub Tree
A tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.
#### Ordered Tree
A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each vertex.
#### Size of a tree
Number of nodes in the tree.
